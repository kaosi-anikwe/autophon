    <title>Autophon - Online Forced Aligner for Nordic Languages | Phonetic Analysis Tool</title>

      content="Forced alignment is a critical phonetic tool that automates the process of phonetically time-stamping speech recordings using advanced techniques such as Hidden Markov models or Deep Neural Networks. For example, Autophon as an online forced aligner harnesses the power of the Montreal Forced Aligner (MFA), which utilizes Kaldi, an ASR program that uses Deep Neural Networks. Similarly, the Penn Forced Aligner makes use of older and more well-established technology, namely the Hidden Markov toolkit. These software packages generate a time-stamped phonetic annotation that can be conveniently read in Praat, a widely-used phonetic analysis software (Boersma and Weenink 2017). They rely on optimizing two essential user inputs: (1) the speech recording and (2) a corresponding orthographic transcription. 
      To function effectively for a specific language, online forced alignment tools require the development of an acoustic model and a comprehensive pronunciation lexicon that covers every word in that language – something which Autophon offers. Online forced alignment serves a crucial role in automating a process that would otherwise be resource-intensive when performed manually. Traditional manual phonetic annotation can consume a significant amount of time, ranging from 250 to 400 minutes for every recorded minute, making it cost-prohibitive in regions with high labor costs.
      In the Nordic context, online forced aligners like Autophon offer a free online solution to phonetic analysis. Linguists and researchers can efficiently align phonetic transcriptions with spoken data, enabling in-depth exploration of language-specific phonological features. For instance, researchers studying Danish, Norwegian or Swedish dialects can utilize forced alignment tools to precisely align transcriptions with audio recordings, facilitating the examination of regional speech variations and dialectal phenomena. Similarly, Autophon can even assist in the analysis of speech rhythm patterns or other prosodic features. By minimizing the time and effort required for phonetic annotation, this online phonetic annotator, otherwise known as an online forced aligner, has become an indispensable tool for researching Nordic phonetics and phonology, allowing for much larger sample sizes and breaking down barriers for linguists and researchers in these regions."
